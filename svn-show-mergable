# svn-show-mergable (part of ossobv/vcutil) // wdoekes/2011 // Public Domain
#
# Shows which revisions are eligible for merging. This is most useful
# when you have a development branch and a live branch and you wish to
# cherry-pick individual commits into the live branch.
#
# It uses the svn:mergeinfo property to read out which revisions are
# still unmerged.
#
# Usage:
#
#     svn-show-mergable [PATH_TO_MERGE_SOURCE]
#
# If PATH_OF_MERGE_SOURCE is not supplied, "live-" is stripped from
# the current path. It assumed you're working in ~/src/live-project and
# ~/src/project.

#     svn-merge-msg (to use after `svn merge`)
