#
# Sends out a nice colored e-mail with the committed changeset for
# each committed revision. It uses the awesome vim(1) syntax
# highlighting to colorize the patch files.
#
# Installation:
#
#     $ cd /path/to/svn/master/repo
#     $ ln -s /usr/local/bin/svn-hook-postcommit-coloremail hooks/post-commit
#
# Usage:
#
#     svn-hook-postcommit-coloremail PATH_TO_MASTER_REPO COMMITTED_REV
#
# FAQ:
#
#     * "svn: Unable to open an ra_local session to URL"
#
#       This means you're not running this on the SVN master
#       repository.
#
#     * Committing takes longer than before.
#
#       Yes, the email is generated during commit time. That means that
#       the submitter of a commit has to wait until the e-mail is
#       generated and sent. We could disown this job and have it run in
#       the background, if needed.
#
#     * Does it cope with non-ASCII?
#
#       It is encoding-agnostic. The mail however assumes everything is
#       in UTF-8. (And the also subject gets sent verbatim. Any
#       non-ASCII in the summary line will be technically invalid, but
#       parsed by modern e-mail clients.)
