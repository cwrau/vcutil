#
# Sends out a nice colored e-mail with the committed changeset for
# each committed revision. It uses the awesome vim(1) syntax
# highlighting to colorize the patch files.
#
# Use this for git repositories that are local only.
#
# Installation:
#
#     $ cd /path/to/local/git/checkout/.git
#     $ ln -s /usr/local/bin/svn-hook-postcommit-coloremail hooks/post-commit
#
# Usage:
#
#     git-hook-postcommit-coloremail
#
# FAQ:
#
#     * I don't want my passwords mailed.
#
#       Use the #CENSORED\# tag on the same line, see censored-for-email.
#
#     * Committing takes longer than before.
#
#       Yes, the email is generated during commit time. That means that
#       the submitter of a commit has to wait until the e-mail is
#       generated and sent. We could disown this job and have it run in
#       the background, if needed.
#
#     * Does it cope with non-ASCII?
#
#       It is encoding-agnostic. The mail however assumes everything is
#       in UTF-8. (And also the subject gets sent verbatim. Any
#       non-ASCII in the summary line will be technically invalid, but
#       parsed by modern e-mail clients.)
#
